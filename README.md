# Hangman: The Perk-Fueled Frenzy

**UNLEASH THE WORD WARRIOR WITHIN**

Get ready to experience the classic game of hangman like never before. I've taken the humble word-guessing game and injected it with a dose of adrenaline, courtesy of Pygame. The result? A thrill ride of linguistic lunacy that will leave you screaming for more.

**PERKS: THE GAME-CHANGERS**

But that's not all, folks! This ain't your grandma's hangman. Oh no. I've added three perks that will tilt the odds in your favor (or drive you utterly mad, depending on your strategy).

1. **The Free Pass**: Press a button, take a stab at a letter. If you're wrong, it's like it never happened. No harm, no foul. Just a gentle whisper in your ear, "Try again, champ."
2. **The Frequency Frenzy**: Want to play the odds? This perk reveals the most common letter in the word. But be warned: if all letters are unique, we're going old school â€“ back to the beginning, my friend!
3. **The Alphabetical Apocalypse**: This is where things get wild. Select a letter, and in a radius of alphabetical chaos, both correct and incorrect letters will be revealed. It's like a linguistic explosion in your face!

**THE CHALLENGE AWAITS**

So, are you ready to put your word-wrangling skills to the test? Can you harness the power of perks to emerge victorious? There's only one way to find out.

**INSTALLATION**
